## Contributing
Before contributing to the project, ask yourself whether the change would benefit a hosted solution or a home user. We welcome contributions to the project. However, we don't wish to add complex new features that are difficult to maintain. This project focuses on simple solutions to complex problems, which improve the performance and stability of the torrent client.

We anticipate you will probably be running this torrent client with [ruTorrent](https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent). This fork is supported by a core maintainer of ruTorrent. Features that enhance ruTorrent capabilities are welcome!
